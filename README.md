# Hi there, I'm Varun 👋

### Senior Product Manager @ Amazon | AI & Technical Product Strategy

I bridge the gap between business strategy and engineering execution. I am passionate about **AI Product Management**, specifically in how **Agentic Workflows** and **RAG architectures** can solve complex user problems.

I believe the best PMs build "Technical Empathy" by getting their hands dirty with code.

### 🚀 What I'm Building

#### 🦁 [Mr. Market's Intelligent Terminal](https://github.com/apjvarun/projectMrMarket)
*A GenAI-powered financial dashboard that democratizes Bloomberg-level insights for the moderate investor.*

* **The Problem:** Retail investors face "Information Overload" and lack the tools to synthesize disparate market data.
* **The Solution:** An Agentic RAG application that combines real-time data visualization with a context-aware financial chatbot.
* **The Tech:** Built with **Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and Google Gemini**. Features include a Router Agent for query classification and Vector Search for context retrieval.

### 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Prototyping:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas.
* **AI/ML Strategy:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Prompt Engineering, LLM Evaluation.
* **Data & Viz:** Plotly, SQL, API Integration.

### 📚 Product Philosophy
1.  **Ship to Learn:** Prototyping beats slide decks. I build MVPs to validate technical feasibility early.
2.  **User-Centricity:** AI is a tool, not the product. The value lies in the friction it removes for the human user.
3.  **Technical Fluency:** Understanding the *constraints* of the technology allows for better roadmap prioritization.
